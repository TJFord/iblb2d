This is a Fluid Structure interaction code based on immersed boudnary method.
Its main purpose is to study blood flow in microcirculation.
The fluid field is solved through Lattice Boltzmann method, while the cells 
are modeled as a membrane network consisting of beads and springs. Two unique
motions related to cells under shear, namely tumbling and tank treading,
can be observed. The effect of RBCs on particle dispersion rate were studied 
and published. If you feel this code is useful for your research, please consider
